          Valorant is an online tactical shooter according to team 5 vs 5 and is
          a FPS game set in a near future. The player who controls agents
          (agents) comes from many countries and cultures in the world. With
          separate characteristics and skills. In the main mode (set of Spike),
          each team has five players who will choose agents with unique skills,
          so that it is suitable for the competition map and tactics for the
          team. Two teams are divided into two sides (Side): Attacker side or
          defense (defender side). Players use the currency in each game to
          recharge and buy armor for themselves, and buy and exchange weapons
          with teammates. A timer bomb is called Spike for the attack faction,
          what they need to do is within 100 seconds to put it in one of the
          spike areas of the map or destroy all the defense faction. If the
          attacking side destroys all the defensive faction or successfully
          defends Spike and let it explode, the attacking side of the game. If
          the defense successfully removed Spike within 45 seconds after Spike
          was placed or after 100 seconds that the attacking side had not placed
          Spike but the defensive faction was still there, the defensive side
          would win the game. In the first game, both sides have 45 seconds to
          prepare, with the next game, withdraw 30 seconds and continue until
          game 13 when the two teams change the side.
